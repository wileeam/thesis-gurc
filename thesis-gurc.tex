    \aclp*{pet} have proven to be a beneficial area of research aiming at lessening
    the threats to the privacy of users' personal information in centralised \acl*{is}
    like \aclp*{osn}. As such, decentralised solutions have been proposed to extend 
    the control that a user has over its data as opposed to the centralised massive 
    collection of personal and sensitive data.
    
    The power that the service provider has in centralised \aclp*{is} has been shown 
    to diminish the user's privacy with cases of misuse, censorship or data leakage. 
    Moreover, the disclosures in 2013 of a global surveillance program led by public 
    intelligence institutions in collaboration with some of the service providers 
    of such centralised \aclp*{is} has accelerated the debate on how to take action 
    to counteract the threat to the ``right to be left alone'' as defined by Alan 
    Westin in 1970. 
    
    Decentralisation as a solution to such threat is plausible and commonly used 
    nowadays. However, removing the central authority comes with two main trade-offs, 
    on one side, mimicking the features of the centralised \acl*{is} in a usable 
    way is not trivial. On the other side, the security and privacy threats 
    that the central authority was supervising and taking care of are now a responsibility 
    to be shared among all participants in the decentralised system.
    
    In our thesis, we propose three different solutions to centralised \aclp*{is}
    varying in the degree of achievable security and privacy, and decentralisation. 
    For decentralised \aclp*{is} in general we show an actual implementation of 
    user authentication via standard user-password credentials. Within the realm 
    of decentralised systems we also show a specific example in the domain of \aclp*{dosn} 
    with the implementation of a coordination and cooperation mechanism to organise 
    events. Finally, in generic centralised privacy-preserving systems we show a 
    mechanism to improve one of the aspects of user's privacy, anonymity, in the 
    academic area to submit and grade documents anonymously.
    
    Our solutions are some concrete examples of how privacy as data control, as 
    envisioned by Anita Allen, can be achieved in different degrees and scenarios 
    within centralised and decentralised \aclp*{is}. Nonetheless, we hope that the 
    privacy-preserving protocols we propose can be useful in other scenarios to 
    mitigate the diverse dangers to personal privacy that we are facing nowadays.

\chapter{Introduction}
    \label{chapter:introduction}

\requote{Intellectual beauty is sufficient unto itself, and only for it rather than 
for the future good of humanity does the scholar condemn himself to arduous and 
painful labors}{Santiago Ram{\'o}n y Cajal}
    
\lettrine{\textcolor[gray]{.25}{I}}{n} 1989, while at the European Particle Physics 
Laboratory, at the \acf{cern}, Tim Berners-Lee invented the \Ac{www}. No one at that 
time would have imagined that such invention has been centric to the rapid development 
of the digital age that we are currently witnessing.

Such period in human history, mainly characterised by an economy based on information 
processing as opposed to the traditional industry of the industrial revolution, 
has widen the availability of uncountable services to the general population with 
access to the Internet. Not only new business opportunities have stemmed as technological 
developments matured but also services have been overhauled to make them available 
in the digital world.

To give an example, interpersonal communication --- the passing of information between 
entities --- has evolved throughout history as communication advances developed. 
The traditional exchange of paper letters as a means of communication between two 
parties, which still prevails today, has evolved into a much more sophisticated 
and complex form in the information age: electronic mail (e-mail), which is simply 
the parallelism in the digital era to such physical letters.

Such evolution in the means of communication among individuals and other entities 
has also happened at other societal levels. For example, the social structures that 
individuals form when sharing similar interests or activities, namely social networks, 
have also seen a transposition in the digital era. The \Internet and the \ac{www} 
have taken the leading role as tools to convey different types of information from 
one party to another, expanding the boundaries of the concept of social networks, 
heavily based on tangible activity between individuals and entities.

While the concept of \acl{sn} is a theoretical term mainly used in the realm of 
social sciences to study and describe the social structures determined by the relationships 
between individuals, groups, and other types of entities such as societies; the 
technological developments of the digital era have popularised its virtual counterpart 
term: \aclp{osn}.

\Acp{osn} are \Internet based applications where the audience --- individuals and 
groups --- create profiles of themselves, connect with others by creating relationships, 
generate heterogeneous content and, share and exchange such content among the connections 
and other users in the network. These networks are, up to a certain extent, a complement 
to the established interactions that individuals already have in their daily lives 
\cite{SubrahmanyamRWE08}. Convenience of building and maintaining relationships 
and enjoyment are among the main motivations driving individuals to disclose personal 
information in such platforms \cite{KrasnovaSKH10}.

These \acp{is} started becoming popular in the second half of the 90s 
with services such as \LiveJournal or \Friendster evolving\footnote{For a comprehensive 
but concise survey on the history and evolution of these networks the reader is 
advised to read \cite{boydE07} and \cite{HeidemannKP12}} to the most popular ones 
nowadays such as \Facebook, \LinkedIn, \Twitter or \GooglePlus.

The building design describing such systems is very similar among them. Their design 
is usually monolithic with a data model that is centralised\footnote{With centralised 
we mean that the control of the data is under the jurisdiction of one entity, usually 
the \ac{osn} service provider, regardless of how such data is stored physically, 
for example, in a distributed or centralised manner.} and a system model consisting 
of some variant of cloud computing architectures \cite{PallisZD11}. 

The main business model is also similar among most \acp{osn} providers. Instead 
of charging the users for the services of the \ac{osn}, the revenue model is based 
on selling advertisements to businesses and companies that want to reach a subset 
of the users in the platform. In fact, some argue that \acp{osn} have become an 
ecosystem for marketing rather than for information \cite{HannaRC11}, and ignoring 
these social media platforms may be the difference between prosperity or failure 
\cite{HarrisR09}.

Such business revenue model based on advertising requires in most cases accepting 
some \ac{tos} and \acp{pp} where the users of the \ac{osn} give up certain rights 
on the data contained in the ``free'' profiles and any other data stemming from 
the interactions among them. For example, \Facebook states in its \ac{tos} that 
the user grants a ``non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and 
worldwide license'' of any intelectual property content posted in the \ac{osn}, 
\LinkedIn and \Twitter state similar \ac{tos} as \Facebook~--- see \cref{chapter:excerpts-of-tos-and-pp} 
for some excerpts of the \ac{tos}.

Users are also more aware of the profitability that \ac{osn} service providers do 
of their content via advertising. Moreover, the concern of users' data privacy in 
\acp{osn} has also increased in recent years particularly when it comes to configuring 
who can access their content. Some studies show that users' engagement with the 
privacy settings is more frequent nowadays and even in line with the use of the 
\ac{osn} \cite{boydH10}.

However, raising awareness among \ac{osn} users of the privacy settings or how they 
can better use the service to protect their privacy or, requesting more transparent 
policies from the \ac{osn} service provider is necessary but still not sufficient. 
Because an important aspect of personal data privacy is actually maintaining control 
over such information --- informational privacy \cite{Cavoukian96}.

Privacy in \acp{osn} has become a topic of ongoing discussions in the current century 
due to the business model of the service providers of \acp{osn}. Nevertheless, the 
focus of the discussions on privacy in \acp{osn} has shifted towards the idea of 
data control --- privacy was already envisioned as data control in the late 90s 
\cite{Allen99}.

\acp{osn} have been on the news for different unfortunate reasons related to privacy, 
to name a few, coercion into self-identification\footnote{See ``Facebook Locks Out Thousands, Now Wants Photo ID'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20150921075721/http://www.conspiracyclub.co/2015/03/25/facebook-asking-gov-id-to-verify-account/}}, 
user data leakages\footnote{See ``Passwords for 32M Twitter accounts may have been hacked and leaked'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161102165137/https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/twitter-hack/}}, 
censorship\footnote{See ``LinkedIn Considers Changes After China Censorship Revealed'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20150927040931/http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/09/03/linkedin-considers-changes-after-china-censorship-exposed/}}, 
intentional misuse\footnote{See ``WhatsApp data sharing with Facebook must be stopped until it can be proved legal, European Union warns'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161029115621/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-data-sharing-facebook-eu-european-union-privacy-safety-opt-out-a7384586.html}} 
and even veto the right to be forgotten\footnote{See ``European Court Lets Users Erase Records on Web'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161013113612/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/technology/google-should-erase-web-links-to-some-personal-data-europes-highest-court-says.html}}

Moreover, \acp{osn} service providers, among other major technological companies, 
have been known to be in the thick of a global surveillance program --- a program 
known as \Ac{prism}\footnote{See ``NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161112033822/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data}} --- 
after the revelations of a former contractor's employee of the \ac{usa} government 
in 2013. For example, not only \Facebook and \Google, had full knowledge of having 
their users' privacy breached without their knowledge and consent but also assisted 
and collaborated willingly in such violation.

The aforementioned scenario certainly pictures a quite pessimistic and probable 
future as it seems that privacy is pretty much extinct --- if it was somewhat possible 
in the past. Even though there are other plausible scenarios that can address the 
use of \acp{osn} in a privacy-preserving manner. A trivial one would be simply not 
using any technology that can pose a threat to privacy but this is impractical in 
the current digital era and irrational. Another solution could be some sort of institutional 
transparent control of service providers but this would allow for collusions between 
service providers and institutions as proven with the \ac{prism} program.

In fact, there is not a perfect solution that addresses the problem. However, the 
idea of privacy as data control is feasible enough to consider as a starting point. 
Because it should be the user the one who decides what happens with her data, how 
it is dealt with and by whom. There is already technology aiding the users keep 
that control while allowing business models to operate without compromising users' 
privacy. For example, \Apple recently unveiled how it is embracing differential 
privacy to collect statistics of its users anonymously\footnote{See ``Apple's `Differential Privacy' Is About Collecting Your Data --- But Not Your Data'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20160901192334/https://www.wired.com/2016/06/apples-differential-privacy-collecting-data/}}.

% DSS BEGIN
An example of a privacy-preserving solution in an \ac{is} is part of 
this thesis in \cref{article:document-submission-system}. In the context of an academic 
institution where personal information about individuals is collected --- for example, 
students' examination documents --- for further processing by a central authority 
--- such as a grading examiner --- we provide a privacy-preserving protocol based 
on blind signatures for anonymous document submission and grading --- the process 
of anonymous grading is popularly known as blind grading in fact. 

Although our solution provides with a procedure to do blind grading in a privacy-preserving 
manner guaranteeing the correctness of the grading process, it relies on a central 
authority to process the data --- for example, to issue and link the credentials with 
the identities of the participants. Such authority --- an academic institution --- 
is a trusted party, but this cannot always be a reasonable assumption in other scenarios 
--- recall the governmental program \ac{prism}.
% DSS END

For these reasons, decentralisation\footnote{In the context of this thesis we adopt 
the definition by Rohit Khare where a decentralised system is ``one which requires 
multiple parties to make their own independent decisions''.} has been proposed in 
some centralised \acp{is} such as \ac{osn} --- namely \acp{dosn} --- 
as one of the foremost steps to minimise the impact on users' privacy by the central 
service provider. Yet decentralisation in \acp{is} does not come for 
free nor it is trivial to achieve because new challenges arise when there is no 
central provider to rely on for basic services such as storage, communication or 
identification.

The main idea in decentralised systems, such as \acp{dosn}, is to provide the services 
of the centralised counterpart without relying on the central authority which was 
assumed to be trusted --- fully or partially --- and making decisions on behalf 
of everyone in the system. This can be done by fully opening the system in such 
a way that every party --- known as peer --- is autonomous, hence interacting directly 
with other parties, for example, sharing information, and, entering or leaving the 
system freely --- anyone can do so at any time. A typical example of an information 
system that is completely decentralised is a \ac{p2p} network.

Such arbitrariness comes with trade-offs because the parties may have conflicting 
interests and goals making the decentralised system susceptible to additional attacks 
from malicious parties. Every party has now some responsibility because there is 
not a central authority where any party can turn to in case of misbehaviour. For 
example, impersonation, denial of service, \Sybil attacks, collusion or deception 
are some of the security threats that a decentralised scenario has to face besides 
other technical ones such as lack of cooperation, network bootstraping or, who and 
how to trust \cite{BucheggerA09}.

Consequently, decentralisation shifts the primary focus of the \ac{is} 
to privacy, security and data portability --- and usable functionality thereafter. 
As the power of the central authority is overruled and distributed among the parties 
in the decentralised system new threats arise in the decentralised context. Without 
any privacy-preserving approach addressing these challenges, the personal data, 
that is now unlocked from the centralised ``silo'', is at the hand of everyone in 
a virtually ungoverned environment.

% P2P BEGIN
Privacy-preserving decentralised \acp{is} is the other focus of this 
thesis. On one side, we show how the classical functionality of user authentication 
can be implemented in a decentralised manner in \cref{article:passwords-peer-to-peer} 
for an \ac{is} in general --- in fact, for a fully decentralised system 
such as a \ac{p2p} network. We supplement the basic login functionality with other 
features such as enabling a user to change her password or even recover a forgotten 
one via her e-mail or some security questions or, store her login credentials on 
some other device --- in a secure form --- for example, a mobile phone, so that 
she does not have to log in every time she wants to use it.

Scalable and usable privacy-preserving user authentication in decentralised systems 
allows for a wider adoption and transition to decentralised \acp{is}. 
For example, the feature of recovering the password via e-mail is a popular solution 
used by many vendors in centralised systems --- including \acp{osn} service providers 
\cite{Kuzma11}. However, such recovery functionality fails its primary function 
when the service provider is not available, or if it becomes malicious and refuses 
to use the e-mail originally provided by the user. 

In our solution we propose a $(n, k)$-secret sharing approach to overcome the absence 
of a central authority. The user chooses $n$ peers who can help her on the recovery 
task and among those, $k$ peers that should be available when recovering the password. 
The user is in control of both parameters --- $n$ and $k$ ---  at all times, unlike 
in the centralised scenario.
% P2P END

% EI BEGIN
On the other side, we show how the basic functionality of organising an event, usually 
available in centralised \acp{osn}, can be implemented in a privacy-preserving manner 
in \acp{dosn} in \cref{article:events-invitations-dosns}. Our proposed solution 
allows a user to create events and invite other users who can confirm their attendance. 
While this functionality is rather simple when there is a trusted third party, such as 
the service provider in an \ac{osn}, implementing such feature without a trusted 
broker that guarantees fairness in the process is not trivial. For example, keeping 
track of who is invited or showing the total number of attendess to those invitees 
who are attending.

Our mechanism uses standard cryptographic primitives allowing other features such 
as revealing some event specific information to a group of users --- to those who 
commit to attend an event --- or even detect any misbehaving party --- for example, 
an invitee can prove that accepted an invitation and did not get further details 
about the event from a malicious organiser.

With our solution we aim at a broader spectrum of privacy-preserving applications 
outside the context of \acp{dosn}. The cooperation and coordination characteristics 
of our specific use case and our secure decentralised solution suggest for applications 
in other domains where there is some collaboration involved between the parties 
and a trusted third party is not ideal or possible at all.
% EI END

Finally, we acknowledge the urgent need for more privacy in \acp{is}. 
In this thesis, we take the approach of decentralising such systems as a way to 
achieve the ideal of privacy as data control as envisioned by Allen \cite{Allen99}. 
We contribute with some insights on how to enhance the control of the user on her 
data in general centralised and decentralised systems, and in particular ones such 
as \acp{dosn}. We also suggest usable privacy-preserving protocols for some specific 
features and show their utility in some concrete scenarios.

\section{Motivation}
    \label{section:motivation}
Our rationale for the line of work of this thesis is data control in the broad sense 
and in line with the notion of ``privacy as data control'' in \cite{Allen99}. We 
drive our reasoning on the three following core user personal data rights\footnote{The 
reader is advised to read more on the three main rights we have in mind in the \Ac{udm} 
at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161010132230/https://userdatamanifesto.org/}.}: 
``control over user data access'', ``knowledge of how data is stored'' and which 
laws or jurisdictions apply and, ``freedom to choose a platform'' without experiencing 
any vendor lock-in.

% The rights stated in the \ac{udm} are, as a matter of fact, a modern version of the
% three notions of `privacy' that \citeauthor{Allen99} stated in \cite{Allen99}: ``personal
% data control or rights of data control'', ``right of personal data control'' and,
% ``enhancing personal data control by individuals is the optimal end of privacy regulation''.

Data control —-- in the essence of data privacy and information security —-- is a 
subject that has gained a lot of attention in the last decade. Particularly from 
major technological corporations such as \Google, \Apple or \Facebook because they 
have been identified as necessary collaborators of institutional surveillance of 
citizens world-wide \cite{Lyon14}.

Although the users of \acp{osn} owned by some of these major corporations are much more 
aware than ever of such collaboration of service providers and governmental institutions 
for mass surveillance \cite{Madden14}. Moreover, users are more willing than before 
to do something to protect their privacy despite the fact that different types of 
information prompt different degrees of sensitivity, for example, social security 
numbers are considered much more sensitive than some habits such as purchasing or 
browsing the \ac{www}.

A well articulated security and privacy strategy is necessary but it is not sufficient 
for a corporation (or governmental institution) to protect the data of its customers 
and users (or citizens) because the data itself is still out of the control of the 
user. Not only the user does not possess such data physically but also does not 
control who access it or even if, and how, gets transferred to third parties --- 
in many cases, unauthorised.

Therefore, we aim at improving users' data control as much as it is technologically 
possible, leaving legal policies such as \ac{tos} or \ac{pp} and, the ethical debate 
out of the scope of this thesis. We believe that removing the central provider in 
a centralised \ac{is} such as an \ac{osn} is one of the very first steps towards 
returning that control of the data back to the user. Although the trade offs of 
getting rid off such entity, for example, who guarantees that two parties can communicate 
between each other without a third one overseeing, ought to be identified, analysed, 
researched and worked out.

Finally, we also have the desire to reduce the impact of personal data privacy in 
people's lives by raising awareness on the topic with our solutions. We want to 
broaden and deepen the ongoing political debate and legal discussions on the topic 
of privacy not only in \acp{osn} but also in many other centralised \acp{is}. However, 
we reckon there is still a long road ahead on the quest of privacy and this is barely 
the beginning.

\section{Outline}
    \label{section:outline}
After putting the reader in the context of \acp{osn} as \acp{is} and the need for 
privacy-preserving approaches by means of decentralisation of such \Internet based 
applications --- \acp{dosn} --- in the current \namecref{chapter:introduction}, 
we continue with a background introduction to the main concepts that we base our 
work on in \cref{chapter:background}. We provide a brief overview of concepts within 
\acp{is} in \cref{section:information-systems-on-the-importance-of-capabilities}, 
centralised and decentralised \acp{osn} in \cref{section:osns-centralisation-vs-decentralisation} 
and privacy in \cref{section:privacy-a-never-ending-battle}.

We continue in \cref{chapter:our-research-problem} with a description of our research 
problem and the challenges we faced to detail our research methodology 
in \cref{section:methodoloy}. Our contributions are listed in \cref{chapter:our-contributions} 
along with a summary of each article for the reader's convenience. We complete this 
thesis with our conclusions and future directions in \cref{chapter:conclusions}.

For completeness, we include a re-print of each publication that we refer in \cref{chapter:our-contributions} 
in \cref{part:published-articles}: \usebibentry{KreitzBGRB12}{title}, \usebibentry{RodriguezCanoG14}{title} 
and, \usebibentry{GreschbachREB15}{title} (\cref{article:passwords-peer-to-peer,article:events-invitations-dosns,,article:document-submission-system} 
respectively). Moreover, and for the reader's reference, we have also included selected 
excerpts of \ac{tos} from three popular \ac{osn} service providers in \cref{chapter:excerpts-of-tos-and-pp}.


\section{Conventions}
    \label{section:conventions}
In this thesis we are using the following conventions in the language used,
\begin{itemize}
    \item The gender used throughout the text while referring to a human being using 
    a computer --- user --- may unintentionally differ, although we tried to be 
    consistent with the gender `she'. However, this thesis is neutral towards gender 
    but to ease the reading we chose such gender --- except in the abstract.

    \item Data and information can be considered synonyms in the broader sense --- 
    the definition of data is a piece of information. In the context of this thesis 
    we will use the latter --- information --- as the abstract fact about something, 
    while the former --- data --- as the encoded form of such information that can 
    be transferred over a network and interpreted by a computer.
    
    \item All the \acp{url} in this thesis --- except the ones in \cref{chapter:excerpts-of-tos-and-pp} ---
    are provided via the \Wayback machine, a digital archive of the \ac{www} and 
    other information on the \Internet created by the \InternetArchive non-profit 
    digital library organisation. The reader has the possibility of accesing a cached 
    snapshot of the version that was used when this thesis was written and also 
    the original \ac{url}. In order to access the original \ac{url}, the reader 
    is advised to remove the timestamped prefix that precedes the original \ac{url} 
    of the form \url{https://web.archive.org/web/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS/}. For example, 
    given the original \ac{url}, \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy}, the 
    \Wayback machine created the following snapshot and its \ac{url} as of the time 
    of this writing, \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161111044417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy}.

\chapter{Background}
    \label{chapter:background}

\requote{Science is always worth because its discoveries, sooner or later, are always 
put to use}{Severo Ochoa de Albornoz}

\lettrine{\textcolor[gray]{.25}{T}}{he} field of \acp{sn} is an extremely vast domain 
of knowledge and research. It has influenced dozens of domains, spanning from the 
most traditional ones such as ethnography or anthropology to more contemporanean 
ones such as genomics or astrophysics.

\Acp{sn} can be considered huge processes of information dissemination --- one of 
the reasons for the varied interest from many domains of knowledge. Such dissemination 
process is one of the basis when forming relations among individuals and other entities 
--- social structures --- and resulting in a set of social relations that we commonly 
know as \acp{sn} and \acp{osn} in their digital counterpart form.

With the explosion of large scale \acp{osn} new challenges have emerged in connection 
with the sudden availability of new types of data. The inherent increase in the 
amount of data poses a technological challenge because there is a need to cope with 
such size. Moreover, there is a need to investigate and develop efficient methods 
that can answer questions in such large space of data within a reasonable amount 
of time.

% http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/be-two-sides-of-the-same-coin
At the same time, the collection of such amount of data in \acp{osn} is having a 
great impact on the privacy of the users who use these networks to share information 
among them. Data and privacy seem to be the two sides of the same coin: \acp{osn} 
\cite{BelkinC92}. On the one side, the retrieval of information --- data --- is 
a necessity when it comes to providing some service, for example, allowing people 
to comment on a picture, and on the other side, the collection of such data opens 
a lot of possibilities on how the data can be used beyond its initial intended purpose 
in other realms, for example, advertising.

As the data is usually stored by a single centralised entity --- the owner of the 
\ac{osn} --- there is also a risk for unintentional wrong-doing of the data without 
the knowledge of the users such as misuse, data leakages or even censorship. Therefore, 
when designing such \acp{is} with social network capabilities \cite{Abrams06, Lunt06, Lunt07, Zhu08, Lunt09}, 
considering privacy is not simply an additional feature to have in the \ac{osn} 
and it does become a requirement. 

Moreover, providing privacy-preserving capabilities is as important as educating 
the users into using the settings built for data control. The risks of exposing 
personal information by not configuring properly the visibility of the data is something 
that is not commonly considered and pose different threats, for example, identity 
theft \cite{GrossAH05, BrandtzaegLS10}. Though the topic of user behaviour with 
privacy-preserving features in \acp{osn} is out of the scope of this thesis.

% TODO: Use cleverref for name of chapter instead of hardcoding background
In the following \namecrefs{section:information-systems-on-the-importance-of-capabilities}
we introduce the reader to the main concepts that this thesis is based on --- however,
the reader should should not consider this chapter a survey because it is not aimed 
at being that and rather an introductory and concise summary of relevant concepts. 
%We provide a brief introduction to \acp{is} in \cref{section:information-systems-on-the-importance-of-capabilities},
We provide a brief introduction to \acp{is} in the following section,
centralised and decentralised \acp{osn} in \cref{section:osns-centralisation-vs-decentralisation}
and privacy in \cref{section:privacy-a-never-ending-battle}.

%\section{\Aclp*{is}: on the importance of capabilities}
\section{Information Systems: on the importance of capabilities}
    \label{section:information-systems-on-the-importance-of-capabilities}

Stair\etal define an \ac{is} as a ``set of interrelated elements or components 
that collect --- input ---, manipulate --- process --- , store, and disseminate 
--- output --- data and information, and provide a corrective reaction --- feedback 
mechanism --- to meet an objective'' \cite{StairR15}. And narrow down the previous 
definition in the domain of \ac{it} with \ac{cbis} defined as a ``single set of 
hardware, software, databases, telecommunications, people, and procedures configured 
to collect, manipulate, store, and process data into information''. 

\Ac{cbis} are usually divided into six parts, which we briefly describe in the context 
of \acp{osn},
\begin{itemize}
    \item hardware,\\
    possibly the most obvious one in any \ac{cbis}. It can be a single machine or 
    many.\\
    In the context of \acp{osn} --- and in the current state of the \Internet 
    --- where it is common to use server farms in data centers all over the world 
    acting as one and, providing a fast, reliable and redundant service. Users usually 
    communicate with one of the farms that is geographically close. In case of failure 
    of any component in one or more servers of the farm --- or even an entire server 
    farm --- the other machines can take over seamlessly --- or simply another server 
    farm.
    
    \item software,\\
    is the set of computer programs that govern the operation of the hardware --- 
    tell the hardware what to do, how to function. These can be either system programs 
    --- usually the operating system --- or application programs such as a text 
    editor or a video player.\\
    In the context of \acp{osn} these would be the collection 
    of programs to process the user requests when accessing the \ac{osn} and other 
    auxiliary programs, for example, to administrate the service, or any client 
    application, for example, to access the service from a mobile. As \acp{osn} 
    have gained most of their popularity on the \ac{www}, the computer programs 
    are the web servers and, engines and frameworks chosen by the service provider 
    to implement the \ac{osn}, for example, the \Apache web server or the \ac{ror} 
    web application framework. Mobile apps are also part of the software, and in 
    the case of \acp{osn} a major player\footnote{Note that the adoption of mobile 
    \Internet is more related to the envision by one of the biggest manufacturers 
    --- \Apple --- to drive the demand for mobile services \cite{WestM10}.} for their 
    success, because of their social nature the user is able to continue interacting 
    from virtually anywhere.
    
    \item communications,\\
    are the set of systems --- networks\footnote{With networks we include not only 
    specific equipment but also auxiliary \acp{is} to enable electronic communications 
    around the world.} --- that allow organisations to distribute tasks by using 
    their resources together even if the computer environments are different.\\
    In the context of \acp{osn} --- and in a great majority of large scale systems --- 
    the communication networks are the \Internet itself which allows the users to 
    access the \ac{osn} service from their mobile phone, laptop or corporate desktop 
    computer.
    
    \item data --- or databases,\\
    as a piece of information --- recall the definition of data and distinction 
    with information in \cref{section:conventions} --- that in the context of \ac{cbis}
    is usually stored in an organised manner denominated database --- an efficient 
    collection of files with a distinctive characteristic of making the stored information 
    easily accessible and fast.\\
    In the context of \acp{osn} content is what drives the growth and evolution 
    of the network. Although the content is of different kinds and sizes, databases 
    are chosen by service providers to make such information available to the users 
    quickly when they interact in the network.
    
    \item processes,\\
    describes how the \ac{cbis} and the data processed is to be used --- the policies, 
    methods and rules --- in order to get the answers for which the \ac{is} was 
    designed. For example, there can be some processes on how to backup the data 
    of the \ac{cbis} at a remote location upon the detection of some fire in the 
    building where it is located.\\
    In the context of \acp{osn} such processes could be related to the policies 
    implemented by the service provider to verify a user when she wants to retrieve 
    her credentials, or the procedure to allow the user to retrieve all her personal 
    data stored in the \ac{osn}.
    
    \item users,\\
    are the individual human beings who use the \ac{cbis} --- and the most important 
    element in the \ac{is} because their success achieving their goals will imply 
    whether the \ac{is} is useful the purpose it was designed for or not. The roles 
    of individuals can vary, they can be either users of the system or personnel 
    who manage, program or maintain the system.\\
    In the context of \ac{osn} the most important individuals are in fact the users. 
    Their success achieving maintaining social interactions in the network will 
    make the network expand --- not necessarily in users but in content derived 
    from the social interactions --- and last over time.
    
\end{itemize}

% https://online.columbiasouthern.edu/CSU_Content/Courses/Business/BBA/BBA3551/12K/UnitV_Chapter8Presentation.pdf?targ
Although \ac{osn} are \ac{cbis} when looking at them from a purely computational 
perspective, there are other approaches to them in \acp{is}. For example, David 
Kroenke names them \acp{smis} and defines them as \acp{is} that ``support sharing 
of content among networks of users'' \cite{Kroenke15}. Others consider these systems 
\acp{wis} because most of the information that can be received and transferred to 
the network happens by means of the \ac{www} although the surge of mobile \Internet 
is rendering this approach inaccurate.

In this thesis we adhere to the concept of \ac{cbis} because we aim at being agnostic 
of biased denominations or means of communication with the \ac{osn}. As we pointed 
out, the mobile \Internet is changing the way information is consumed by users revamping 
the \ac{www} as the leading source of information.

% \section{\Aclp*{osn}: centralisation \vs decentralisation}
\section{Online Social Networks: centralisation \vs decentralisation}
    \label{section:osns-centralisation-vs-decentralisation}
While there is a wide understanding among researchers and practitioners on what 
a \ac{sn} is and, by extension, an \ac{osn}, there is not a canonical definition 
of neither of them in the literature. Authors seem to define their own ``interpretation'' 
as they see fit to their particular problem to solve or topic to discuss without 
much general consensus --- see, for example, \cite{AdamicA05}, \cite{DwyerHP07}, \cite{SchneiderFKW09} 
and \cite{RichterRB11}.

In our work, we have opted for the definition by boyd\etal because we believe that 
it is the most representative for recent works in the field of \acp{osn} --- an 
\ac{osn} site is a ``web-based service that allows individuals to construct a public 
or semi-public profile within a bounded system, articulate a list of other users 
with whom they share a connection, and view and traverse their list of connections 
and those made by others within the system'' --- \cite{boydE07}. Although this definition 
has been critiqued for being too broad as well \cite{Beer08}.

The two most important parts of the previous definition are the means of communication 
--- the \ac{www} --- and the administration of the users' profiles and their connections 
in a system. This system is what we need to clarify in fact because the \ac{www} 
is, by construction, an interconnected set of systems thus inherently\footnote{
\Internet traffic nowadays is increasingly concentrating through specific nodes, 
owned by major technological corporations such as \Amazon or \Google, offering cloud 
services and fostering a centralisation of the data in the \ac{www} which is seen 
as a dangerous concentration of `power' by some activists \cite{Bolychevsky13}} 
distributed.

Popular centralised \acp{osn} such as \Facebook, \Twitter or \GooglePlus take different 
approaches in the way they have designed their users' profiles and the mechanisms 
for which users share and traverse the connections among them and, exchange information. 
However, most of the data is still stored, processed, administered and managed by 
the owner of the \ac{osn}\footnote{The owner may use a distributed architecture 
to provide the service while still keep full control of all the nodes in such setup.}.

Traditional \acp{osn}, as \acp{is}, are controlled by a single authority --- the 
service provider--- regardless of the chosen infrastructure of the \ac{cbis} --- 
for example, in a distributed manner --- to provide the service to the users. There 
are many reasons for which many \acp{osn} designs are centralised with the most 
prominent ones lying on the side of data control\footnote{Do not confuse data control 
with data ownership. The latter is still a right that the user who uploaded the content 
to the \ac{osn} usually keeps. See \cref{chapter:excerpts-of-tos-and-pp} for some 
examples of \acp{tos} with the legal wording on this matter.} towards business value 
by means of data mining \cite{DomingosR01}.

However, such centralisation by a single authority poses many threats to the owner 
of the data --- the user --- because she does not know what happens with her data 
after such data is transferred into the \ac{osn}. Even if the specific uses and 
purposes are specified in the \ac{tos} and \ac{pp}, the user will not know how much 
effort the service provider will put into abiding by them. There are many unfortunate 
examples of misuse in the media as we highlighted in the \lcnameref{chapter:introduction}.
Such instances are factual breaches of security of the \ac{osn} infrastructure but 
more importantly, probable violations of the privacy of \ac{osn} users' personal 
information --- see \cite{CutilloMS10} or \cite{GaoHHWC11} for examples of attacks 
against \acp{osn} affecting the privacy, integrity and availability of personal 
data of the users.

For that reason, decentralisation is the most common solution proposed nowadays 
as a solution to the central authority that amasses all the personal data shared 
by the users in centralised \acp{osn}. However, decentralisation is not an easy 
task and usually there is not one single solution, for example, \cite{ShakimovVCC09} 
describes three alternative architectures to decentralised \acp{osn} --- namely, 
cloud based, desktop based with socially informed replication and a hybrid of the 
former two --- differing in privacy, costs and availability trade-offs. 

Past research has focused on removing the central provider and guaranteeing the 
confidentiality of users' personal data --- via cryptographic algorithms and protocolos 
--- but little has been done to address other major trade-offs when distributing 
the responsibilities of the central authority among the users of the \ac{osn} \cite{GreschbachKB12}
.% --- see \cref{section:related-work} for \lcnameref{section:related-work} on \acp{dosn}.

When decentralising an \ac{osn} --- and other similar centralised \acp{is} --- one 
has to consider how to address topics such as identification of the users or personal 
data storage.
% has to consider how to address topics such as identification of the users, personal
% data storage and, access control policies --- and their enforcement --- for
% the stored data as well information accountability.

\textit{Identification}. In traditional \acp{osn} --- and most centralised \acp{is} 
--- authentication of users for the purpose of accessing the system is done by the 
service provider itself or via some authorised trusted third party. The central 
authority keeps and maintains a registry of records with diverse information about 
the user for the purpose of authenticating the user after identifying her. The authority 
usually has some other identifying information should the user forgets her credentials 
and needs to gain access to the system again.

When decentralising such mechanisms of identification and authentication there is 
not a central authority to which rely on to guarantee unique identifiers or recovering 
the credentials. One of the solutions for a user to identifying herself in such 
scenario would be using public key cryptography because the user could use the public 
key as identifier while authenticate herself since she holds the paired private key. 

Although cryptographic identifiers are not memorable for the users nor portable 
enough for the dynamism of \acp{osn} and the different devices where they are used 
nowadays. A solution to this would be using a \ac{pki} for which there are decentralised 
solutions such as the web of trust ---  decentralised networks of \ac{p2p} certification 
--- of \ac{pgp} \cite{Stallings95, Abdul97}. But they do not prevent a user from 
registering a public key under the identity of an already registered user --- identity 
retention. 

% TODO: Mention Twister as example?
Such consistency guarantee is now possible thanks to leveraging on the blockchain 
that enables cryptocurrencies such as \Bitcoin \cite{Nakamoto08}. The blockchain 
is a distributed sequential database of growing list of records --- blocks of transactions. 
Because blocks can only be appended to the list, it is not possible to alter already 
registered transactions. Such immutability --- among others like the self-organised 
\ac{p2p} network to have one single chain --- can be used to impose such consistency 
guarantee for identifiers in a \ac{dosn} setup.

\textit{Data storage}. Decentralising storage in \acp{osn} is another key challenging 
task because it is not enough with partitioning the information among a set of nodes 
using some algorithm to increase availability and redundancy. There requirements 
of integrity and confidentiality are also crucial, particularly when the goal is 
to eliminate or reduce the power of the central authority --- recall that it is 
still possible to have a distributed storage system controlled by a single authority 
requiring trust in such third party which is what we aim at removing.

Survivable storage systems provide the fundamental requirement of no node, service 
nor user can be fully trusted. Persistence of data in such self-securing storage 
systems is entrusted to a set of nodes --- rather than to individual ones --- able 
to monitor and repair themselves guaranteeing malfunctioning and malicious compromises 
of storage nodes. Nodes in such systems store the data as in any decentralised storage 
and protect it as an independent entity --- self-securing requirement --- making 
them different from `regular' decentralised storage systems \cite{WylieBSGKK00}.
 
The unique characteristics of survivable storage systems are likely to be the closest 
to the main properties of the most popular decentralised storage engine used when 
decentralising \acp{osn}, \acp{dht}. \acp{dht} are distributed storage systems storing 
information in key-value pairs and providing a lookup service --- usually by key 
in a dictionary-like fashion.

Decentralisation, integrity, scalability, fault tolerance and anonymity are among 
the properties that any \ac{dht} should meet in a \ac{dosn}. As the varying overlay 
network topologies, routing algorithms, data models, churn management techniques and, 
security attack resilience are largely vast in the state of the art we direct the 
reader to a survey on \ac{p2p} content distribution, \cite{Androutsellis-TheotokisSLS10} 
and another one on \ac{dht} security techniques, \cite{UrdanetaPS11}.

\section{Privacy: a never ending battle}
    \label{section:privacy-a-never-ending-battle}

Privacy, as a fundamental human right recognised in the \ac{un} Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights and in many other 
international treaties, can be defined as ``the right to be let alone'' \cite{Westin70}. 
Although Westin's approach is one of many attempts throughout history to define 
the concept of privacy notably determined by aspects such as context, culture, people 
or even expectations on what an individual can have as privacy.

Westin describes the following four states of privacy, solitude, as being free from 
observation by others, intimacy, as group seclusion to achieve a close and relaxed 
relationship, anonymity, as freedom from identification and surveillance --- in 
public places and acts --- and, reserve, as the desire to limit disclosures to others 
--- implying that those others must respect such desire. That is, as a continuous 
process of adjustments where each individual has to consider the need for privacy 
and the desires for disclosure and communication to others in a societal context.

Another approach to privacy --- of great interest in our work --- is the definition 
of ``privacy as data control'' by Allen \cite{Allen99}. Although data control is 
a complex paradigm that hinders conflicting interests because, as Allen says, ``it 
obscures the need for concern that individuals will want too little privacy and 
also the concern that people will want too much privacy''. For example, it seems 
reasonable to let individuals keep control of their financial data --- as it is 
rather sensitive personal information, but certain obligations --- such as tax laws, 
oblige individuals to share this type of information to governmental agencies and 
even society.

Privacy is important because it helps individuals keep that individuality and autonomy 
that defines them. An individual should be able to exercise control over its personal 
information in a freely manner without coercions nor restrictions. It is not even 
admissible to be questioned on such choices about what is shared --- or not, how, 
when, with whom or for which purpose. Moreover, privacy becomes even more important 
when we consider its functional benefits. For example, an individual may use a pseudonym 
to sign some controversial political statements as a safeguard for her anonymity.

Although some argue that there is some sort of paradox with privacy threats bringing 
privacy benefits \cite{WittesL15}. Academics and activists seem to mainly focus 
on the loss of some specific privacy, usually surveillance and tracking related, 
but there are other technologies that while diminishing such type of privacy enhance 
other types. For example, an individual may care what some others know about her 
but does not mind \Google know what she is trying to find on the \ac{www} by using 
\Google's search engine.

The debate on privacy is a long-standing one and much of it we owe to Westin for 
bringing a modern view of privacy to society during the digital revolution, to some 
extent preparing the general public and lawmakers for the digital era to come. Privacy 
cannot be thought as a good or feature that can merely be enhanced, for example, 
with \acp{pet}, nor just threatened, for example, by governmental surveillance. 
Privacy is a matter of personal preference in most cases and that is what Allen 
meant with privacy as data control.

\subsection{`Decentralising' privacy}
    \label{subsection:decentralising-privacy}
The privacy challenges in \acp{osn} are rather demanding and complex because it is 
not simply a responsibility of the service provider in such centralised scenario 
and, instead, it is a responsibility of all the stakeholders in the \ac{osn}. Everyone  
is responsible to address the threats that are awaiting, for example, extortion 
or identitiy theft \cite{GrossAH05}. 

In centralised scenarios, the service provider must be clear with the \ac{pp} and 
the \ac{tos} on what happens to the personal data of the users in the platform. 
Moreover, the central authority should provide proper and straightforward settings 
for the user to control who can access her data so that she can protect herself. 

However, having such features does not mean the user will actually use them, or   
do so right \cite{KrishnamurthyW08, BrandtzaegLS10}. Even if the configuration is 
done correctly, there may be some false sense of safety and privacy. Those other 
trusted ones can easily expose that personal information without realising that 
they are doing so, for example, a user may tag a friend in a picture revealing her 
precise location at some point of time \cite{ZhelevaG09, SmithSHV12}. 

On the other hand, service providers need to make a living out of the `free' service
they offer --- the \ac{osn}. Nowadays, users are aware, more than ever, of the data 
mining that most of these services apply on their content --- not necessarily because 
it is explicitly stated in the \ac{tos} though. Such data mining is not done only 
by the service provider but also other third parties whom the owner of the \ac{osn} 
is sharing data with --- including potentially sensitive information. In most cases, 
the shared data is claimed to be protected via anonymization but the robustness 
of such processes has been proven to be weak allowing for re-identification \cite{NarayananS09}.

% TODO: Replace section at the end of paragraph for command via cleverrref
In decentralised scenarios the challenges are greater as many of the safeguards 
provided by the service provider do not exist anymore. All the problems and issues 
become a responsibility of the users in the network because there is not a central 
authority to rely on as we briefly discussed in the previous section.

The security and privacy trade-offs of decentralisation have been focused on keeping 
personal data confidential and intact --- by means of cryptographic protocols and 
algorithms, in line with previous perspectives of privacy, for example, in law \cite{Harvey92} 
or in healthcare \cite{BarrowsC96}. 

Although confidentiality and integrity are necessary, they are not sufficient because 
regardless of any authentication and data control mechanisms implemented in a decentralised 
scenario there are other problems to consider. For example, the inferences that 
an attacker can make from the meta-data that the central authority was protecting 
in the centralised scenario and are available in the decentralised setup if not addressed 
in the design of the \ac{dosn} \cite{GreschbachKB12}.

\chapter{Our research problem}
    \label{chapter:our-research-problem}

\requote{Poetry is a succession of questions which the poet constantly poses}{Vicente 
P{\'i}o Marcelino Cirilo Aleixandre y Merlo}

\lettrine{\textcolor[gray]{.25}{W}}{e} aim at providing some privacy-preserving 
methods to improve user data control in the realm of centralised and decentralised 
\acp{is} and, in a particular instance of \acp{cbis}, \acp{dosn}.

Centralised \acp{is} are the most popular systems on the \Internet as the business 
strategy of most enterprises owning such systems is fundamentally built around control. 
For example, \Facebook, which has been accused\footnote{See ``Zuckerberg: Facebook will develop tools to fight fake news'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161120010511/http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/19/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-news-election/}} 
recently of not doing enough to prevent fake news in its network, would probably 
benefit from sharing some details on how its news filtering processes work for the 
research community to assess, but doing so would likely expose details of its infrastructure 
to its competitors.

In this thesis we aim at reducing the amount of control that a service provider 
can do in a centralised \ac{is}. Either by improving the privacy of some steps of 
a process in a centralised scenario --- if we are constrained to keep such authority, 
for example, in a semi-trusted scheme, or by analysing what happens when the central 
authority is taken away and, designing and evaluating privacy-enhancing alternatives 
instead. 

% Whether centralised or decentralised \acp{is} are better is not part of our research
% problem. Although we acknowledge that this is an interesting open question. 


\section{Challenges addressed}
    \label{section:challenges-addressed}
Among the wide spectrum of problems and questions that decentralisation poses in 
centralised \acp{is} such as \acp{osn} we have first focused our efforts on keeping 
the functionality of some features in decentralised systems as close as possible 
to what these would be in the centralised scenario.

In parallel, such decentralisation triggers our second concern in terms of privacy.
Not only we consider this topic in such setup where the central authority does not 
exist or it plays a minimal role but also in a more generic fashion for an \ac{is}. 
When reducing the tasks of the central authority to the minimum, the users in the 
system are exposed to some security and privacy threats that should be analysed 
and addressed.

Each one, decentralisation and privacy, raise so many questions that any thesis 
or research will ever be able to answer. Therefore, we list the main questions that 
we believe this thesis answers in the aforementioned domains. There may be additional 
questions we have not explicitly considered but the reader finds an answer in our 
work. Moreover, the reader may expect answers to some questions that we have not 
even thought as of the time of this writing --- though this is the beauty of research.

\end{itemize}

\section{Delimitations}
    \label{section:delimitations}
In the realm of this thesis, centralised and decentralised \acp{is}, including a 
user case of the latter ones, \acp{dosn}, we are not aiming, nor we have, at building 
a functional system as per the definition of \ac{cbis} in \cref{section:information-systems-on-the-importance-of-capabilities}.

\section{Methodology}
    \label{section:methodoloy}
Computer science is the study of the phenomena that surrounds computers by means 
of the theory, experiments and design that leads to the actual construction of computers. 
The computer is not only a collection of interconnected pieces of hardware but also 
a programmed ``living'' device --- as defined by Newell\etal the studied ``organism'' 
--- \cite{NewellS76}.

As such, and derived from the natural sciences as a continuous process, we take 
the scientific method as the main approach to address our research problem by systematic 
observation, measurement, experimentation, induction and formulation of hypotheses, 
testing of our deductions, and possibly the modification of such hypotheses \cite{Oxford14}.

Among the most prominent research methodologies used nowadays --- quantitative and 
qualitative --- we do not side with any of them and instead take a mixed approach. 
Mixed methods research gives a greater flexibility when answering research questions 
rather than constraining approaches or ideas. We try to find research questions 
that offer the best chance to obtain useful and meaningful answers. And we think 
that a combined approach achieves the best results \cite{JohnsonO04}.

Such mixed methods approach leads us to design science research methodologies for 
\acp{is}, which consist of six main steps: identification and motivation of the 
problem, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development of 
the solution, demonstration, evaluation and finally, communication of the research 
\cite{PeffersTRC07}. We use the previous criteria to classify and describe the works 
included in this thesis in \cref{table:papers-methodologies}.

\lettrine{\textcolor[gray]{.25}{W}}{hen} Tim Berners-Lee invented the \Ac{www} in 
1989, he envisioned a large-scale and decentralised \ac{is} where everybody would 
be able to have their own website and plug-in a server from which they could offer 
their content. Such idea never worked out and, instead, personal data ended up under 
the control of major technological companies in huge data centers --- ``silos'' 
--- distributed all over the world.

% https://archive.org/details/DWebSummit2016_Keynote_Tim_Berners_Lee
% https://web.archive.org/web/20161106081045/https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/09/a-decentralized-web-would-give-power-back-to-the-people-online/
The idea of bringing back the initial design of a decentralised \ac{www} has been 
in the minds of researchers and practitioners for a while now --- ``bring back the 
power to the people'' as Tim Berners-Lee said during his keynote ``Re-decentralizing 
the web -- some strategic questions'' at the ``Decentralized Web Summit'' in 2016. 

Decentralisation of \acp{is} on the \Internet --- or re-decentralisation --- has 
gained popularity in recent years due to increasing concerns on the risks of personal 
data misuse by major technological companies as they oversee a large portion of 
the data circulating the \Internet.

Until the turn of the 21st century the focus was on the privacy concerns of individuals 
as consumers and the policy making in that direction --- see some examples at \cite{MilbergBSK95}, 
\cite{Rindfleisch97}, \cite{Clarke99} and \cite{NamSPI06}. However, in 2013, the 
focus shifted to governmental mass surveillance after the disclosures of Edward 
Snowden --- a former contractor of the \aca{usa} government --- on the existence 
of a global surveillance apparatus led by the \aca{usa} government \Ac{nsa} in cooperation 
with other intelligence organisations and in partnership with major technological 
players such as \Google, \Facebook or \Apple. 

Such idea of decentralisation is what motivates this thesis as means to achive 
privacy as data control in similar terms as those stated by Allen \cite{Allen99}. 
Though overruling the power of a central authority like the service provider of 
an \ac{osn} entails sharing the duties and responsibilities among a subset of federated 
servers or among all the users of the network in a \ac{p2p} fashion. In other words, 
there are many non-trivial trade-offs to consider which are worth the effort of 
being looked at.

With this thesis we aim at contributing to the field of centralised \acp{is} by 
presenting solutions showing that decentralisation is not only possible but also 
improves the control that a user has over her personal data --- her privacy is enhanced. 
We specify and design some protocols showing how some common functionality in 
generic \acp{is} can be mimicked in a decentralised scenario, such as a \ac{p2p} 
network, or in a more specific one, such as a \ac{dosn}. We also demonstrate how 
in some conventional process where privacy is not seen that important it is possible 
to enhance the privacy of a user while keeping the functionality intact in a scenario 
where a trusted central authority is required.

For decentralised \acp{is} we present in \cref{article:passwords-peer-to-peer} an 
scheme for usable privacy-preserving user authentication in a similar manner --- 
via user-password credentials --- than what most \acp{is} use nowadays with key 
functionality to recover the credentials or even maintain the authentication details 
stored in a secure manner across devices with a negligible impact on performance.

In a specific use case of decentralised \acp{is} within the realm of \acp{osn}, 
\acp{dosn}, we demonstrate how it is possible to have a coordination and cooperation 
mechanism such as the organisation of events without the need of a \ac{ttp} in \cref{article:events-invitations-dosns}. 
Along with standard cryptographic primitives we describe some privacy-enhancing 
tools that allow storage location indirection --- control of the ability to access 
an encrypted object and possibly to decrypt it as well, or controlled cipher-text 
inferences --- allowing certain leak information such as the size of an encrypted 
object but not its content --- and define a ``commit-disclose'' protocol --- where 
some information is disclosed to a certain set of users who have fulfilled some 
requirement.

We also tackled the problem of anonymity in centralised \ac{is} with a prototype 
implementation of a document submission and grading system in \cref{article:document-submission-system} 
without compromising the correctness of the process. By means of standard cryptographic 
primitives such as blind signatures we propose a protocol that guarantees ``forward 
unlinkability'' of a document with the author over time --- an examiner will not 
be able to link the author of a document with the document itself even after reporting 
the grade for that document --- and, ``provable linkability'' of an author's identity 
with the grade for its document --- an author of a document is guaranteed to receive 
a grade if and only the author submitted the document.

% TODO: Replace chapter with macro command
Finally, we also aim at bringing back --- once more --- the debate on privacy because 
the envisioned ``Big Brother'' society that George Orwell pictured is not far from 
being part of our daily lives \cite{Orwell49}. The solutions to some of the security 
and privacy problems we have presented in the previous chapters are some examples on 
how we can actually achieve some compromises to resolve the conflict between the 
need and value for information and the cost of personal privacy.

\section{Future directions}
    \label{section:future-directions}
Ideas? I need some more...

- More features/functionality

- Other scenarios where decentralisation fits

- More formal security and privacy evaluation

- Privacy-preserving analytics

- Protection of the social network graph from within

    \Facebook's \acs{tos} are called ``Statement of Rights and Responsibilities
    '' and available at \url{https://www.facebook.com/terms}. The last revision as of 
    this writing is dated on January 30th, 2015. The following is an excerpt of some 
    selected sections of the \ac{tos}.

        \[...\]
        \textbf{Privacy}

        Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Policy to make important 
        disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we collect 
        and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Policy, 
        and to use it to help you make informed decisions. 

        \vspace{\baselineskip}

        \textbf{Sharing Your Content and Information}

        You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control 
        how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos 
            and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, 
            subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, 
            transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP 
            content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP 
            License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content 
            has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
    
            \item When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying 
            the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content 
            may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be 
            available to others).
    
            \item When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission 
            to access your content and information as well as content and information that 
            others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy, 
            and your agreement with that application will control how the application can 
            use, store, and transfer that content and information.  (To learn more about 
            Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share 
            with applications, read our Data Policy and Platform Page.)
    
            \item When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means 
            that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access 
            and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and 
            profile picture).
    
            \item We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, 
            but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any 
            obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer 
            them).

        \textbf{Your License to LinkedIn}
        
        As between you and LinkedIn, you own the content and information that you 
        submit or post to the Services and you are only granting LinkedIn the following 
        non-exclusive license: A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right 
        to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish, and process, information and 
        content that you provide through our Services, without any further consent, 
        notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in 
        the following ways:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
            \item You can end this license for specific content by deleting such 
            content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except 
            (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and 
            they copied or stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to 
            remove from backup and other systems.
            \item We will not include your content in advertisements for the products 
            and services of others (including sponsored content) to others without 
            your separate consent. However, we have the right, without compensation 
            to you or others, to serve ads near your content and information, and 
            your comments on sponsored content may be visible as noted in the Privacy 
            Policy.
            \item We will get your consent if we want to give others the right to 
            publish your posts beyond the Service. However, other Members and/or 
            Visitors may access and share your content and information, consistent 
            with your settings and degree of connection with them.
            \item While we may edit and make formatting changes to your content 
            (such as translating it, modifying the size, layout or file type or 
            removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your expression.
            \item Because you own your content and information and we only have 
            non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, 
            including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.
        \end{enumerate}
        You agree that we may access, store and use any information that you provide 
        in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your privacy settings.

        By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, 
        you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback 
        for any purpose without compensation to you.

        You agree to only provide content or information if that does not violate 
        the law nor anyone's rights (e.g., without violating any intellectual property 
        rights or breaching a contract). You also agree that your profile information 
        will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain information 
        or content in certain countries.
        \[...\]
        \textbf{Limits}
        
        LinkedIn reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including 
        the number of your connections and your ability to contact other Members. 
        LinkedIn reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account 
        if LinkedIn believes that you may be in breach of this Agreement or law 
        or are misusing the Services (e.g. violating any Do and Don'ts).

        LinkedIn reserves all of its intellectual property rights in the Services. 
        For example, LinkedIn, SlideShare, LinkedIn (stylized), the SlideShare and 
        “in” logos and other LinkedIn trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos 
        used in connection with LinkedIn are trademarks or registered trademarks 
        of LinkedIn. Other trademarks and logos used in connection with the Services 
        may be the trademarks of their respective owners

        \textbf{Your Rights}
        
        You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or 
        through the Services. What’s yours is yours — you own your Content (and 
        your photos and videos are part of the Content).

        By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, 
        you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the 
        right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, 
        transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution 
        methods (now known or later developed). This license authorizes us to make 
        your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the 
        same. You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to provide, 
        promote, and improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through 
        the Services available to other companies, organizations or individuals 
        for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication of 
        such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions 
        for such Content use. Such additional uses by Twitter, or other companies, 
        organizations or individuals, may be made with no compensation paid to you 
        with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise 
        make available through the Services.

        Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact 
        with your Content on the Services. These rules exist to enable an open ecosystem 
        with your rights in mind. You understand that we may modify or adapt your 
        Content as it is distributed, syndicated, published, or broadcast by us and 
        our partners and/or make changes to your Content in order to adapt the Content 
        to different media. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, 
        power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any 
        Content that you submit.
