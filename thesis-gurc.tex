\chapter{Introduction}
In 1989, while at the European Particle Physics Laboratory, at \ac{cern}, Tim Berners-Lee 
invented the \Ac{www}. No one at that time would have imagined that such invention 
has been centric to the rapid development of the digital age that we are currently 
witnessing.

Such period in human history, mainly characterised by an economy based on information 
processing as opposed to the traditional industry of the industrial revolution, 
has widen the availability of uncountable services to the general population with 
access to the Internet. Not only new business opportunities have stemmed as technological 
developments matured but also services have been overhauled to make them available 
in the digital world.

To give an example, interpersonal communication --- the passing of information between 
entities --- has evolved throughout history as communication advances developed. 
The traditional exchange of paper letters as a means of communication between two 
parties, which still prevails today, has evolved into a much more sophisticated 
and complex form in the information age: electronic mail (e-mail), which is simply 
the parallelism in the digital era to such physical letters.

Such evolution in the means of communication among individuals and other entities 
has also happened at other societal levels. For example, the social structures that 
individuals form when sharing similar interests or activities, namely social networks, 
have also seen a transposition in the digital era. The Internet and the \ac{www} 
have taken the leading role as tools to convey different types of information from 
one party to another, expanding the boundaries of the concept of social networks, 
heavily based on tangible activity between individuals and entities.

While the concept of social networks is a theoretical term mainly used in the realm 
of social sciences to study and describe the social structures determined by the 
relationships between individuals, groups, and other types of entities such as societies; 
the technological developments of the digital era have popularised its virtual counterpart 
term: \aclp{osn}.

\chapter{Research problem}
\section{Challenges addressed}

\chapter{Background}
The field of \acp{sn} is an extremely vast domain of knowledge and research. It 
has influenced dozens of domains, spanning from the most traditional ones such as 
ethnography or anthropology to more contemporanean ones such as genomics or astrophysics.

With the explosion of large scale \acp{osn} new challenges have emerged in connection 
with the sudden availability of new types of data. Moreover, the inherent increase 
in the amount of data poses a technological challenge because there is a need to 
cope with such size, and there is as well a scientifical challenge as to finding 
methods that can answer questions in such large space of data. 

At the same time, the collection of all this data affects privacy.


\section{Information systems: on the importance of capabilities}
% This section seems more appropiate for the phd...
% Reference: Social Networks and Information Systems: Ongoing and Future Research Streams
% Short summary: The IS research drawing on social networks can be divided into the following streams: 1) network awareness at both individual and organizational levels, 2) uses of social network analysis related to IS use, and 3) conceptual and technological change in the fast evolving platforms to manage social networks


\section{Online social networks: centralised vs decentralised}

What a social network is
defintion

How most designs are centralised (and why)
What it means decentralised
How we can decentralise such centralisation
Trade off (this leads to the main point of privacy that comes now)

\section{Privacy: a never ending battle}

What privacy is

Privacy is a fundamental human right recognized in the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights and in many other international and regional treaties.

What it implies
Why is it important
How it can be breached or attacked or diminished
What can we do
