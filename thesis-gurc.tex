    Privacy-enhancing technologies may help lessen the threats to the privacy of 
    users' personal information in centralised systems like \aclp*{osn}. As such, 
    decentralised solutions have been proposed to extend user's control over its 
    data.
    
    current solutions are made of building blocks, we show some of them in the categories
    of decentralized systems in general, particular systems like osns and more generic
    privacy-preserving systems.

\chapter{Introduction}
    \label{chapter:introduction}
\lettrine{\textcolor[gray]{.25}{I}}{n} 1989, while at the European Particle Physics 
Laboratory, at the \acf{cern}, Tim Berners-Lee invented the \Ac{www}. No one at that 
time would have imagined that such invention has been centric to the rapid development 
of the digital age that we are currently witnessing.

Such period in human history, mainly characterised by an economy based on information 
processing as opposed to the traditional industry of the industrial revolution, 
has widen the availability of uncountable services to the general population with 
access to the Internet. Not only new business opportunities have stemmed as technological 
developments matured but also services have been overhauled to make them available 
in the digital world.

To give an example, interpersonal communication --- the passing of information between 
entities --- has evolved throughout history as communication advances developed. 
The traditional exchange of paper letters as a means of communication between two 
parties, which still prevails today, has evolved into a much more sophisticated 
and complex form in the information age: electronic mail (e-mail), which is simply 
the parallelism in the digital era to such physical letters.

Such evolution in the means of communication among individuals and other entities 
has also happened at other societal levels. For example, the social structures that 
individuals form when sharing similar interests or activities, namely social networks, 
have also seen a transposition in the digital era. The \Internet and the \ac{www} 
have taken the leading role as tools to convey different types of information from 
one party to another, expanding the boundaries of the concept of social networks, 
heavily based on tangible activity between individuals and entities.

While the concept of \acl{sn} is a theoretical term mainly used in the realm of 
social sciences to study and describe the social structures determined by the relationships 
between individuals, groups, and other types of entities such as societies; the 
technological developments of the digital era have popularised its virtual counterpart 
term: \aclp{osn}.

\Acp{osn} are \Internet based applications where the audience --- individuals and 
groups --- create profiles of themselves, connect with others by creating relationships, 
generate heterogeneous content and, share and exchange such content among the connections 
and other users in the network. These networks are, up to a certain extent, a complement 
to the established interactions that individuals already have in their daily lives 
\cite{SubrahmanyamRWE08}.

These information systems started becoming popular in the second half of the 90s 
with services such as \LiveJournal or \Friendster evolving\footnote{For a comprehensive 
but concise survey on the history and evolution of these networks the reader is 
advised to read \cite{boydE07} and \cite{HeidemannKP12}} to the most popular ones 
nowadays such as \Facebook, \LinkedIn, \Twitter or \GooglePlus.

The building design describing such systems is very similar among them. Their design 
is usually monolithic with a data model that is centralised\footnote{With centralised 
we mean that the ownership and control of the data is under the jurisdiction of 
one entity, usually the provider of the \ac{osn}, regardless of how such data is 
stored physically, for example, in a distributed or centralised manner.} and a system 
model consisting of some variant of cloud computing architectures \cite{PallisZD11}. 

The main business model is also similar among most \acp{osn} providers. Instead 
of charging the users for the services of the \ac{osn}, the revenue model is based 
on selling advertisements to businesses and companies that want to reach a subset 
of the users in the platform. In fact, some argue that \acp{osn} have become an 
ecosystem for marketing rather than for information \cite{HannaRC11}, and ignoring 
these social media platforms may be the difference between prosperity or failure 
\cite{HarrisR09}.

Such business revenue model based on advertising requires in most cases accepting 
some \ac{tos} and \acp{pp} where the users of the \ac{osn} give up certain rights 
on the data contained in the ``free'' profiles and any other data stemming from 
the interactions among them. For example, \Facebook states in its \ac{tos} that 
the user grants a ``non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and 
worldwide license'' of any intelectual property content posted in the \ac{osn}, 
\LinkedIn and \Twitter state similar \ac{tos} as \Facebook~--- see \cref{section:excerpts-facebook,section:excerpts-linkedin,section:excerpts-twitter}.

Users are also more aware of the profitability that \ac{osn} service providers do 
of their content via advertising. Moreover, the concern of users' data privacy in 
\acp{osn} has also increased in recent years particularly when it comes to configuring 
who can access their content. Some studies show that users' engagement with the 
privacy settings is more frequent nowadays and even in line with the use of the 
\ac{osn} \cite{boydH10}.

However, raising awareness among \ac{osn} users of the privacy settings or how they 
can better use the service to protect their privacy or, requesting more transparent 
policies from the \ac{osn} service provider is necessary but still not sufficient. 
Because an important aspect of personal data privacy is actually maintaining control 
over such information --- informational privacy \cite{Cavoukian96}.

Privacy in \acp{osn} has become a topic of ongoing discussions in the current century 
due to the business model of the service providers of \acp{osn}. Nevertheless, the 
focus of the discussions on privacy in \acp{osn} has shifted towards the idea of 
data control --- privacy was already envisioned as data control in the late 90s 
\cite{Allen99}.

\acp{osn} have been on the news for different unfortunate reasons related to privacy, 
to name a few, coercion into self-identification\footnote{See ``Facebook Locks Out Thousands, Now Wants Photo ID'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20150921075721/http://www.conspiracyclub.co/2015/03/25/facebook-asking-gov-id-to-verify-account/}}, 
user data leakages\footnote{See ``Passwords for 32M Twitter accounts may have been hacked and leaked'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161102165137/https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/twitter-hack/}}, 
censorship\footnote{See ``LinkedIn Considers Changes After China Censorship Revealed'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20150927040931/http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/09/03/linkedin-considers-changes-after-china-censorship-exposed/}}, 
intentional misuse\footnote{See ``WhatsApp data sharing with Facebook must be stopped until it can be proved legal, European Union warns'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161029115621/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-data-sharing-facebook-eu-european-union-privacy-safety-opt-out-a7384586.html}} 
and even veto the right to be forgotten\footnote{See ``European Court Lets Users Erase Records on Web'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161013113612/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/technology/google-should-erase-web-links-to-some-personal-data-europes-highest-court-says.html}}

Moreover, \acp{osn} service providers, among other major technological companies, 
have been known to be in the thick of a global surveillance program --- a program 
known as \Ac{prism}\footnote{See ``NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161112033822/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data}} --- 
after the revelations of a former contractor's employee of the \ac{usa} government 
in 2013. For example, not only \Facebook and \Google, had full knowledge of having 
their users' privacy breached without their knowledge and consent but also assisted 
and collaborated willingly in such violation.

The aforementioned scenario certainly pictures a quite pessimistic and probable 
future as it seems that privacy is pretty much extinct --- even if it was somewhat 
possible before. Even though there are other plausible scenarios that can address the use of 
\acp{osn} in a privacy-preserving manner. A trivial one would be simply not using 
any technology that can pose a threat to privacy but this is impractical in the 
current digital era and irrational. Another solution could be some sort of institutional 
transparent control of service providers but this would allow for collusions between 
service providers and institutions as proven with the \ac{prism} program.

In fact, there is not a perfect solution that addresses the problem. However, the 
idea of privacy as data control is feasible enough to consider as a starting point. 
Because it should be the user the one who decides what happens with her data, how 
it is dealt with and by whom. There is already technology aiding the users keep 
that control while allowing business models to operate without compromising users' 
privacy. For example, \Apple recently unveiled how it is embracing differential 
privacy to collect statistics of its users anonymously\footnote{See ``Apple's `Differential Privacy' Is About Collecting Your Data --- But Not Your Data'' at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20160901192334/https://www.wired.com/2016/06/apples-differential-privacy-collecting-data/}}.

% DSS BEGIN
An example of a privacy-preserving solution in an information system is part of 
this thesis in \cref{article:document-submission-system}. In the context of an academic 
institution where personal information about individuals is collected --- for example, 
students' examination documents --- for further processing by a central authority 
--- such as a grading examiner --- we provide a privacy-preserving protocol based 
on blind signatures for anonymous document submission and grading --- the process 
of anonymous grading is popularly known as blind grading in fact. 

% In such scenario, our proposed protocol guarantees what we defined as ``forward
% unlinkability'' of a document with the author --- a document and its author's identity
% must remain unlinkable even after receiving a grade --- and ``provable linkability''
% of an author with a grade --- the system must guarantee that an author receives
% a grade if and only if the author submitted a document for grading that was actually
% graded.

Although our solution provides with a procedure to do blind grading in a privacy-preserving 
manner guaranteeing the correctness of the grading process, it relies on a central 
authority to process the data --- for example, to issue and link the credentials with 
the identities of the participants. Such authority --- an academic institution --- 
is a trusted party, but this cannot always be a reasonable assumption in other scenarios 
--- recall the governmental program \ac{prism}.
% DSS END

For these reasons, decentralisation\footnote{In the context of this thesis we adopt 
the definition by Rohit Khare where a decentralised system is ``one which requires 
multiple parties to make their own independent decisions''.} has been proposed in 
some centralised information systems such as \ac{osn} --- namely \acp{dosn} --- 
as one of the foremost steps to minimise the impact on users' privacy by the central 
service provider. Yet decentralisation in information systems does not come for 
free nor it is trivial to achieve because new challenges arise when there is no 
central provider to rely on for basic services such as storage, communication or 
identification.

The main idea in decentralised systems, such as \acp{dosn}, is to provide the services 
of the centralised counterpart without relying on the central authority which was 
assumed to be trusted --- fully or partially --- and making decisions on behalf 
of everyone in the system. This can be done by fully opening the system in such 
a way that every party --- known as peer --- is autonomous, hence interacting directly 
with other parties, for example, sharing information, and, entering or leaving the 
system freely --- anyone can do so at any time. A typical example of an information 
system that is completely decentralised is a \ac{p2p} network.

Such arbitrariness comes with trade-offs because the parties may have conflicting 
interests and goals making the decentralised system susceptible to additional attacks 
from malicious parties. Every party has now some responsibility because there is 
not a central authority where any party can turn to in case of misbehaviour. For 
example, impersonation, denial of service, \Sybil attacks, collusion or deception 
are some of the security threats that a decentralised scenario has to face besides 
other technical ones such as lack of cooperation, network bootstraping or, who and 
how to trust \cite{BucheggerA09}.

Consequently, decentralisation shifts the primary focus of the information system 
to privacy, security and data portability --- and usable functionality thereafter. 
As the power of the central authority is overruled and distributed among the parties 
in the decentralised system new threats arise in the decentralised context. Without 
any privacy-preserving approach addressing these challenges, the personal data, 
that is now unlocked from the centralised ``silo'', is at the hand of everyone in 
a virtually ungoverned environment.

% P2P BEGIN
Privacy-preserving decentralised information systems is the other focus of this 
thesis. On one side, we show how the classical functionality of user authentication 
can be implemented in a decentralised manner in \cref{article:passwords-peer-to-peer} 
for an information system in general --- in fact, for a fully decentralised system 
such as a \ac{p2p} network. We supplement the basic login functionality with other 
features such as enabling a user to change her password or even recover a forgotten 
one via her e-mail or some security questions or, store her login credentials on 
some other device --- in a secure form --- for example, a mobile phone, so that 
she does not have to log in every time she wants to use it.

Scalable and usable privacy-preserving user authentication in decentralised systems 
allows for a wider adoption and transition to decentralised information systems. 
For example, the feature of recovering the password via e-mail is a popular solution 
used by many vendors in centralised systems --- including \acp{osn} service providers 
\cite{Kuzma11}. However, the functionality fails its primary function when the service 
provider is not available, or if it becomes malicious and refuses to use the e-mail 
originally provided by the user. 

In our solution we propose a $(n, k)$-secret sharing approach to overcome the absence 
of a central authority. The user chooses $n$ peers who can help her on the recovery 
task and among those, $k$ peers that should be available when recovering the password. 
The user is in control of both parameters --- $n$ and $k$ ---  at all times, unlike 
in the centralised scenario.

On the other side, we show how the basic functionality of organising an event, usually 
available in centralised \acp{osn}, can be implemented in a privacy-preserving manner 
in \acp{dosn} in \cref{article:events-invitations-dosns}. Our proposed solution 
allows a user to create events and invite other users who can confirm their attendance. 
While this functionality is rather simple when there is a trusted third party, such as 
the service provider in an \ac{osn}, implementing such feature without a trusted 
broker that guarantees fairness in the process is not trivial. For example, keeping 
track of who is invited or showing the total number of attendess to those invitees 
who are attending.

Our mechanism uses standard cryptographic primitives allowing other features such 
as revealing some event specific information to a group of users --- to those who 
commit to attend an event --- or even detect any misbehaving party --- for example, 
an invitee can prove that accepted an invitation and did not get further details 
about the event from a malicious organiser.

With our solution we aim at a broader spectrum of privacy-preserving applications 
outside the context of \acp{dosn}. The cooperation and coordination characteristics 
of our specific use case and our secure decentralised solution suggest for applications 
in other domains where there is some collaboration involved between the parties 
and a trusted third party is not ideal or possible at all.
% EI END

Finally, we acknowledge the urgent need for more privacy in information systems. 
In this thesis, we take the approach of decentralising such systems as a way to 
achieve the ideal of privacy as data control as envisioned by Allen \cite{Allen99}. 
We contribute with some insights on how to enhance the control of the user on her 
data in general centralised and decentralised systems, and in particular ones such 
as \acp{dosn}. We also suggest usable privacy-preserving protocols for some specific 
features and show their utility in some concrete scenarios.

\section{Motivation}
    \label{section:motivation}
Our rationale for the line of work of this thesis is data control in the broad sense 
and in line with the notion of ``privacy as data control'' in \cite{Allen99}. We 
drive our reasoning on the three following core user personal data rights\footnote{The 
reader is advised to read more on the three main rights we have in mind in the \Ac{udm} 
(\url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161010132230/https://userdatamanifesto.org/}).}: 
``control over user data access'', ``knowledge of how data is stored'' and which 
laws or jurisdictions apply and, ``freedom to choose a platform'' without experiencing 
any vendor lock-in.

% The rights stated in the \ac{udm} are, as a matter of fact, a modern version of the
% three notions of `privacy' that \citeauthor{Allen99} stated in \cite{Allen99}: ``personal
% data control or rights of data control'', ``right of personal data control'' and,
% ``enhancing personal data control by individuals is the optimal end of privacy regulation''.

Data control —-- in the essence of data privacy and information security —-- is a 
subject that has gained a lot of attention in the last decade. Particularly from 
major technological corporations such as \Google, \Apple or \Facebook because they 
have been identified as necessary collaborators of institutional surveillance of 
citizens world-wide \cite{Lyon14}.

Although the users of \acp{osn} owned by some of these major corporations are much more 
aware than ever of such collaboration of service providers and governmental institutions 
for mass surveillance \cite{Madden14}. Moreover, users are more willing than before 
to do something to protect their privacy despite the fact that different types of 
information prompt different degrees of sensitivity, for example, social security 
numbers are considered much more sensitive than some habits such as purchasing or 
browsing the \ac{www}.

A well articulated security and privacy strategy is necessary but it is not sufficient 
for a corporation (or governmental institution) to protect the data of its customers 
and users (or citizens) because the data itself is still out of the control of the 
user. Not only the user does not possess such data physically but also does not 
control who access it or even if, and how, gets transferred to third parties --- 
in many cases, unauthorised.

Therefore, we aim at improving users' data control as much as it is technologically 
possible, leaving legal policies such as \ac{tos} or \ac{pp} and, the ethical debate 
out of the scope of this thesis. We believe that removing the central provider in 
a centralised information system such as an \ac{osn} is one of the very first steps 
towards returning that control of the data back to the user.

Finally, we also have the desire to reduce the impact of personal data privacy in 
people's lives by raising awareness on the topic with our solutions to broaden and 
deepen the ongoing political debate and legal discussions. However, there is still 
a long road ahead on the quest of privacy and this is barely the beginning.

\section{Conventions}
In this thesis we are using the following conventions in the language used,
\begin{itemize}
    \item The gender used throughout the text while referring to a human being using 
    a computer --- user --- may unintentionally differ, although we tried to be 
    consistent with the gender `she'. However, this thesis is neutral towards gender 
    but to ease the reading we chose such gender (except in the abstract).

    \item Data and information can be considered synonyms in the broader sense --- 
    the definition of data is a piece of information. In the context of this thesis 
    we will use the latter --- information --- as the abstract fact about something, 
    while the former --- data --- as the encoded form of such information that can 
    be transferred over a network and interpreted by a computer.
    
    \item All the \acp{url} in this thesis are provided via the \Wayback machine, 
     a digital archive of the \ac{www} and other information on the \Internet created 
     by the \InternetArchive non-profit digital library organisation. The reader 
     has the possibility of accesing a cached snapshot of the version that was used 
     when this thesis was written and also the original link. In order to access 
     the original link, the reader is advised to remove the timestamped prefix that 
     precedes the original \ac{url} of the form \url{https://web.archive.org/web/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS/}. For 
     example, given the original link \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy}, 
     the \Wayback machine created the following snapshot and its \ac{url} as of 
     the time of this writing, \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20161111044417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy}.

\chapter{Research problem}
\lettrine{\textcolor[gray]{.25}{W}}{e} aim at providing solutions for user's data 
control in the realm of \acp{dosn}.

Main idea of the problem we are trying to solve (or shortlist of them but try to come up with a general idea first)
Privacy-Preserving methods for services in decentralized systems in general and applied ones


\section{Challenges addressed}
Among the wide spectrum of problems and questions that decentralisation poses in 
information systems such as \acp{osn} we have first focused our efforts on keeping 
the functionality of some features in decentralised systems as close as possible to 
what these would be in a centralised scenario.

In parallel, such decentralisation triggers our second concern in terms of privacy.
Not only we consider this topic in such setup where the central provider does not 
exist or it plays a minimal role but also in a more generic fashion for an information 
system.

Each one, decentralisation and privacy, raise so many questions that any thesis 
or research will ever be able to answer. Therefore, we list the main questions that 
we believe this thesis answers in the aforementioned domains although there may 
be other questions unintentionally answered that we have not thought of as of this 
writing,
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can we decentralize an information system? If so, how?\\
	Paper A and B
	\item Can we mimic some of the features of centralised systems in a decentralised setup?\\
	Paper A and B
	\item What are the trade-offs when protecting the privacy of the user in an information system?\\
	Paper A, B and C
\end{itemize}

---
Keep functionality of OSNs (in the decentralised scenario) while provide such functionality 
in a privacy-preserving manner.

Practice is nothing without theory and viceversa (but there are trade offs when leaning to either side).

Talk about delimitations as well

\chapter{Background}
\lettrine{\textcolor[gray]{.25}{T}}{he} field of \acp{sn} is an extremely vast domain of knowledge and research. It 
has influenced dozens of domains, spanning from the most traditional ones such as 
ethnography or anthropology to more contemporanean ones such as genomics or astrophysics.

% TODO: Do I need to include something here to make the transititon from SNs to OSNs? Otherwise, maybe rephrase the next paragraph and start with such transition?

With the explosion of large scale \acp{osn} new challenges have emerged in connection 
with the sudden availability of new types of data. The inherent increase in the 
amount of data poses a technological challenge because there is a need to cope with 
such size. Moreover, there is a need to investigate and develop efficient methods 
that can answer questions in such large space of data within a reasonable amount 
of time.

% http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/be-two-sides-of-the-same-coin
At the same time, the collection of such amount of data in \acp{osn} is having a great 
impact on the privacy of the users who use these networks to share information among 
them. Data and privacy seem to be the two sides of the same coin: \acp{osn} \cite{BelkinC92}. 
On the one side, the retrieval of information --- data --- is 
a necessity when it comes to providing some service, for example, allowing people 
to comment on a picture, and on the other side, the collection of such data opens 
a lot of possibilities on how the data can be used beyond its initial intended purpose 
in other realms, for example, advertising.

As the data is usually stored by a single centralised entity --- the owner of the 
\ac{osn} --- there is also a risk for unintentional wrong-doing of the data without 
the knowledge of the users such as misuse, data leakages or even censorship. Therefore, 
when designing such information systems with social network capabilities \cite{Abrams06, Lunt06, Lunt07, Zhu08, Lunt09}, 
considering privacy is not simply an additional feature to have in the \ac{osn} 
and it becomes a requirement. 

Moreover, it is as important to provide privacy-preserving capabilities than to 
educate the users into using them. The risks of exposing personal information by 
not configuring properly the visibility of the data is something that is not commonly 
considered and pose different threats, for example, identity theft \cite{GrossAH05, BrandtzaegLS10}. 
However, the topic of user behaviour with privacy-preserving features in \acp{osn} 
is out of the scope of this thesis.

\section{Information systems: on the importance of capabilities}
% Reference: Social Networks and Information Systems: Ongoing and Future Research Streams
% Short summary: The IS research drawing on social networks can be divided into the following streams: 1) network awareness at both individual and organizational levels, 2) uses of social network analysis related to IS use, and 3) conceptual and technological change in the fast evolving platforms to manage social networks

\subsection{Information systems in this thesis}
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system}

A computer(-based) information system is essentially an IS using computer technology to carry out some or all of its planned tasks. The basic components of computer-based information systems are:

Hardware- these are the devices like the monitor, processor, printer and keyboard, all of which work together to accept, process, show data and information.
Software- are the programs that allow the hardware to process the data.
Databases- are the gathering of associated files or tables containing related data.
Networks- are a connecting system that allows diverse computers to distribute resources.
Procedures- are the commands for combining the components above to process information and produce the preferred output.

\section{\Aclp{osn}: centralisation vs decentralisation}
While there is a wide understanding among researchers and practitioners on what 
a \ac{sn} is and, by extension, an \ac{osn}, there is not a canonical definition 
of neither of them in the literature. Authors seem to define their own ``interpretation'' 
as they see fit to their particular problem to solve or topic to discuss without 
much general consensus. See, for example, \cite{AdamicA05}, \cite{DwyerHP07}, \cite{SchneiderFKW09} 
and \cite{RichterRB11}.

In our work, we have opted for the definition by boyd\etal because we 
believe it is the most representative for recent works in the field of \acp{osn} 
--- an \ac{osn} site is a ``web-based service that allows individuals to construct 
a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, articulate a list of other 
users with whom they share a connection, and view and traverse their list of connections 
and those made by others within the system'' --- \cite{boydE07}. Although this definition 
has been critiqued for being too broad as well \cite{Beer08}.

The two most important parts of the previous definition are the means of communication 
--- the \ac{www} --- and the administration of the users' profiles and their connections 
in a system. It is this system what we need to clarify in fact because the \ac{www} 
is, by construction, an interconnected set of systems thus inherently distributed\footnote{
Although \Internet traffic nowadays is increasingly concentrating through specific 
nodes, owned by major corporations, offering cloud services and allowing a centralization 
of the data in the \ac{www} Bolychevsky, Irina (12 November 2013). "BBC Radio Five Live". Outriders (Interview). Interview with Jamillah Knowles. Retrieved 12 December 2013.}. 
But the \ac{osn} is a traditionally centralised system as opposed to distributed 
systems such as the \ac{www}.

%"As we've gone on there's been more and more internet traffic focused through particular 
% nodes such as Google or Facebook. [...] Centralised services that hold all the user data and host it themselves have become increasingly popular because that business model has worked. As the Internet has become more mass market, people are not necessarily willing or knowledgable to host it themselves, so where that hosting is outsourced it's become the default, which allows a centralization of power and a centralization of data that I think is worrying."[149]


There are many reasons for which most \acp{osn} designs are centralised with the 
most prominent ones lying on the side of data control --- ownership --- 
towards business value by means of data mining \cite{DomingosR01}.

Popular centralised \acp{osn} such as \Facebook, \Twitter or \GooglePlus take different 
approaches in the way they have designed their users' profiles and the mechanisms 
for which users share and traverse the connections among them and, exchange information. 
However, most of the data is still stored, processed, administered and managed by 
the owner of the \ac{osn}\footnote{The owner may use a distributed architecture 
to provide the service while still keep full control of all the nodes in such setup.}.

\subsection{\aclp{dosn} in this thesis}


\section{Privacy: a never ending battle}
Privacy as a fundamental human right recognized in the \ac{un} Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights and in many other 
international treaties, can be defined as ``the right to be let alone'' \cite{The Right to Privacy (article)
}.

Although there have been many attempts thorughout history to define privacy from different
perspectives, for example, as part of a legal framework or as a social value.
---
One definition of interest that englobes all this stuff from Westin who describes 
four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. These states must balance participation against norms:

% Data control is a complex paradigm that hinders conflicting interests. For example,
% while it seems reasonable to let individuals keep control of their financial data,
% as it is rather sensitive personal information, certain obligations, such as tax
% laws, oblige individuals to share this type of information to governmental agencies
% and even society \cite{Allen99}.

Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives. - Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968[48]

\chapter{Methodology}
Computer science is the study of the phenomena that surrounds computers by means 
of the theory, experiments and design that leads to the actual construction of computers. 
That is, the computer is not only a collection of interconnected pieces of hardware 
but also a programmed ``living'' device --- the studied ``organism'' --- \cite{NewellS76}.

As such, and derived from the natural sciences as a continuous process, we take 
the scientific method as the main approach to address our research problem by systematic 
observation, measurement, experimentation, induction and formulation of hypotheses, 
testing of our deductions, and possibly the modification of such hypotheses \cite{Oxford14}.
