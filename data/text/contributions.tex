% Benny's thesis
% The problem of how to transfer credentials in a usable and secure way from one device to another is one of the concerns of Article B contained in this thesis. The proposed solution emulates the traditional username/password-login paradigm in a decentralized system.

\subsection{Contributions}
    \label{subsection:contributions-p2p}
I contributed actively in the discussions we held for the design of the protocols 
with ideas and improvements, for example, I helped with the formalisation of some 
of the protocols such as the password recovery mechanism.

\subsection{Contributions}
    \label{subsection:contributions-ei}
I developed, with Benjamin Greschbach, the problem statement as well as the formalisations 
of the security and privacy properties, and the protocols we devised. I also contributed 
with Benjamin in the evaluation of the implementation and the tools we devised.

% In such a scenario, our proposed protocol guarantees what we defined as ``forward
% unlinkability'' of a document with the author --- a document and its author's identity
% must remain unlinkable even after receiving a grade --- and ``provable linkability''
% of an author with a grade --- the system must guarantee that an author receives
% a grade if and only if the author submitted a document for grading that was actually
% graded.

\subsection{Contributions}
    \label{subsection:contributions-dss}
Together with Benjamin Greschbach, I developed the problem statement, the formalisation 
of the security and privacy properties, and the analysis and evaluation of our solution. 
Tomas Ericsson implemented a proof-of-concept of the problem statement and contributed 
actively in the formalisation \cite{Ericsson15}.
