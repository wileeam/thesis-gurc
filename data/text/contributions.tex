% Benny's thesis
% The problem of how to transfer credentials in a usable and secure way from one device to another is one of the concerns of Article B contained in this thesis. The proposed solution emulates the traditional username/password-login paradigm in a decentralized system.

\subsection{Contributions}
    \label{subsection:contributions-p2p}
I contributed actively in the discussions we held for the design of the protocols 
with ideas and improvements, for example, I helped with the formalisation of some 
of the protocols such as the password recovery mechanism.

\subsection{Contributions}
I developed, with Benjamin Greschbach, the problem statement as well as the formalisations 
of the security and privacy properties, and the protocols we devised. I also contributed 
with Benjamin in the evaluation of the implementation and the tools we devised.

% Clarifications:
% % Here, I think it gets contradictory to say the services have "very bad reputation", yet they are "popular".
% - Infamous vs popularity:
%   The `bad reputation' of OSNs services is a fact that media has covered widely
%   with numerous cases of intenational and unintentaional data leakages, censorship,
%   and even collaboration with national governments to access personal data without
%   consent. See the introduction for some of those news covered by media worldwide.
%   However, such examples of privacy threats don't seem to affect that much the success
%   of such services. Every year, the numbers reported by some of these services providers
%   to their stakeholders do nothing but just increase.
%   Although, while the success of such networks cannot be questioned given that popularity,
%   the users are more aware of their own privacy and data sharing activities in these
%   networks.
%
% - Communication between participants:
%   The `abstract' exchanges of information among the participants in the protocols,
%   that is, organiser sends invitiations to invitees, are assumed to be protected
%   against techniques such as traffic analysis (by reason that if they were not protected,
%   a third party could infer who are the invitees just by analysing the outgoing
%   traffic from the organised when she sends the issued invitiations to them).
%   For example, a trarffic analysis protection such as XXX can be used in our scenario.

% In such scenario, our proposed protocol guarantees what we defined as ``forward
% unlinkability'' of a document with the author --- a document and its author's identity
% must remain unlinkable even after receiving a grade --- and ``provable linkability''
% of an author with a grade --- the system must guarantee that an author receives
% a grade if and only if the author submitted a document for grading that was actually
% graded.

\subsection{Contributions}
Together with Benjamin Greschbach, I developed the problem statement, the formalisation 
of the security and privacy properties, and the analysis and evaluation of our solution. 
Tomas Ericsson implemented a proof-of-concept of the problem statement and contributed 
actively in the formalisation \cite{Ericsson15}.
