One of the differences between typical peer-to-peer (P2P) and client-server
systems is the existence of user accounts. While many P2P applications, like
public file sharing, are anonymous, more complex services such as
decentralized online social networks require user authentication. In these,
the common approach to P2P authentication builds on the possession of
cryptographic keys. A drawback with that approach is usability when users
access the system from multiple devices, an increasingly common scenario.

In this work, we present a scheme to support logins based on users knowing a
username-password pair. We use passwords, as they are the most common
authentication mechanism in services on the Internet today, ensuring strong
user familiarity. In addition to password logins, we also present supporting
protocols to provide functionality related to password logins, such as
resetting a forgotten password via e-mail or security questions. Together,
these allow P2P systems to emulate centralized password logins. The
results of our performance evaluation  indicate that incurred delays
are well within acceptable bounds.
